## Impacts on population indices if scientific surveys are excluded from marine protected areas

Code for an analysis of impacts on population indices if scientific surveys are
excluded from the Northern Shelf Bioregion MPA network in British Columbia,
Canada.

Many raw data files are not yet pushed since they are is rather large and may
still change.

R files in `analysis` need to be run in sequence according to their number.
Some components take considerable time to run (hours to a day).

This README will be updated before the associated paper is accepted and the
code is archived.

The paper text is hosted in an Overleaf repository and will likely be copied
here.
