@article{mcgilliard2015,
  abstract = {Some fish stock assessments are conducted in regions that contain no-take marine reserves (NTMRs). NTMRs are expected to lead to spatial heterogeneity in fish biomass by allowing a buildup of biomass inside their borders while fishing pressure occurs outside. Stock assessments do not typically account for spatial heterogeneity caused by NTMRs, which may lead to biased estimates of biomass. Simulation modeling is used to analyze the ability of several stock assessment configurations to estimate current biomass after the implementation of a single, large NTMR. Age-structured spatial operating models with three patterns of ontogenetic movement are used to represent the ``true'' population dynamics. Results show that assessing populations as a single stock with use of fishery catch-rate data and without accounting for the NTMR results in severe underestimation of biomass for two of the movement patterns. Omitting fishery catch-rate data or allowing time-varying dome-shaped selectivity after NTMR implementation leads to improved estimates of current biomass, but severe bias in estimated trends in biomass over time. Performing separate assessments for fished areas and NTMRs leads to improved estimation performance in the absence of movement among assessment areas, but can severely overestimate biomass otherwise. Performing a spatial assessment with estimation of movement parameters among areas was found to be the best way to assess a species, even when movement patterns were unknown. However, future work should explore the performance of spatial assessments when catchability varies among areas.},

Relative trawl availability was defined as the ratio of population density estimates from a scientific bottom-trawl survey to those derived from visual strip transects. Several natural and reaction behaviour variables were explored to explain between-species variation in relative trawl availability. The variable with most explanatory power was spatial dispersion, with aggregating species showing lower relative availability than those that were randomly or uniformly distributed. This variable was also strongly correlated with ROV density estimates (aggregated species had the highest densities). Mean distance off the ground and mean body length of a species were positively related to relative trawl availability. In contrast, the way different species reacted to the ROV did not appear to be correlated with relative trawl availability.},

  abstract = {Rockfish (Sebastes spp.) biomass is difficult to assess withstandard bottom trawl or acoustic surveys because of their propensity to aggregate near the seafloor in highreliefareas that are inaccessible to sampling by trawling. We compared the ability of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), a modified bottom trawl, and a stereo drop camera system(SDC) to identify rockfish species and estimate their size composition. The ability to discriminate species was highest for the bottom trawl and lowest for the SDC. Mean lengths and size distributions varied among the gear types, although a larger number of length measurements could becollected with the bottom trawl and SDC than with the ROV. Dusky (S. variabilis), harlequin (S. variegatus), and northern rockfish (S. polyspinis), and Pacific ocean perch (S. alutus) were the species observed in greatest abundance. Only dusky and northern rockfish regularly occurred in trawlable areas, whereas these two species and many more occurred in untrawlable areas. The SDC was ableto resolve the height of fish off the seafloor, and some of the rockfish species were observed only near the seafloor in the acoustic dead zone. This finding is important, in that fish found exclusively in the acoustic dead zone cannot be assessed acoustically. For these species, methodssuch as bottom trawls, long-lines, or optical surveys using line transect or area swept methods will be the only adequate means to estimate the abundance of these fishes. Our results suggest that the selection of appropriatemethods for verifying targets will depend on the habitat types and species complexes to be examined.},

  abstract = {Understanding population dynamics of fish stocks is essential in developing optimal fisheries management strategies. This is often obtained through fitting mathematical models to information/data collected from the fisheries to estimate vital fisheries parameters and their uncertainties. The quantity of fisheries information, often positively related to economic and social values of fisheries, is one of the most important factors influencing the quality of fisheries parameter estimation. We classify the data quantity into two categories: diversity of the information, defined as the number of sources from which the information about a fisheries variable is collected, and number of observations made for a given fisheries variable. Using an abalone fishery as an example, we demonstrate the importance of data quantity in stock assessment and management. Deficiency in data quantity tends to yield biased assessment of the status of fisheries stock and increase the uncertainty in stock assessment, subsequently complicating the identification of an optimal management strategy. This study suggests that there is a need to determine the relative importance of different types of fisheries data for stock assessment in allocating sampling effort to ensure that the most critical information is collected.},

  abstract = {Populations often show complex spatial and temporal dynamics, creating challenges in designing and implementing effective surveys. Inappropriate sampling designs can potentially lead to both under-sampling (reducing precision) and over-sampling (through the extensive and potentially expensive sampling of correlated metrics). These issues can be difficult to identify and avoid in sample surveys of fish populations as they tend to be costly and comprised of multiple levels of sampling. Population estimates are therefore affected by each level of sampling as well as the pathway taken to analyze such data. Though simulations are a useful tool for exploring the efficacy of specific sampling strategies and statistical methods, there are a limited number of tools that facilitate the simulation testing of a range of sampling and analytical pathways for multi-stage survey data. Here we introduce the R package SimSurvey, which has been designed to simplify the process of simulating surveys of age-structured and spatially-distributed populations. The package allows the user to simulate age-structured populations that vary in space and time and explore the efficacy of a range of built-in or user-defined sampling protocols to reproduce the population parameters of the known population. SimSurvey also includes a function for estimating the stratified mean and variance of the population from the simulated survey data. We demonstrate the use of this package using a case study and show that it can reveal unexpected sources of bias and be used to explore design-based solutions to such problems. In summary, SimSurvey can serve as a convenient, accessible and flexible platform for simulating a wide range of sampling strategies for fish stocks and other populations that show complex structuring. Various statistical approaches can then be applied to the results to test the efficacy of different analytical approaches.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to relate species occurrence and density to local environmental conditions, and often include a spatially correlated variable to account for spatial patterns in residuals. Ecologists have extended SDMs to include spatially varying coefficients (SVCs), where the response to a given covariate varies smoothly over space and time. However, SVCs see relatively little use perhaps because they remain less known relative to other SDM techniques. We therefore review ecological contexts where SVCs can improve the interpretability and descriptive power from SDMs, including local responses to regional indices that represent ecological teleconnections; density-dependent habitat selection; spatially varying detectability; and context-dependent covariate responses that represent interactions with unmeasured covariates. We then illustrate three additional examples in detail using the vector autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model. First, a spatially varying decadal trends model identifies decadal trends for arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stomias density in the Bering Sea from 1982 to 2019. Second, a trait-based joint SDM highlights the role of body size and temperature in spatial community assembly in the Gulf of Alaska. Third, an age-structured SDM for walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus in the Bering Sea contrasts cohorts with broad spatial distributions (1996 and 2009) and those that are more spatially constrained (2002 and 2015). We conclude that SVCs extend SDMs to address a wide variety of ecological contexts and can be used to better understand a range of ecological processes, e.g. density dependence, community assembly and population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Marine Protected Areas require comprehensive monitoring to ensure objectives are achieved; however, monitoring natural ecosystems at scale is challenged by the biodiversity it aims to measure. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding holds promise to address this monitoring challenge. We conducted paired sampling at 54 sites for fish and invertebrate assemblages in the Northwest Atlantic using groundfish trawls and eDNA metabarcoding of benthic seawater using four genetic markers (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, 18S rRNA, and CO1). Compared to trawling, eDNA detected similar patterns of species turnover, larger estimates of gamma diversity, and smaller estimates of alpha diversity. A total of 63.6\% (42/66) of fish species captured by trawling were detected by eDNA, along with an additional 26 species. Of the 24 missed detections by eDNA, 12 were inevitable as they lacked reference sequences. Excluding taxa assigned to higher than species level and those without a species name, 23.6\% (17/72) of invertebrate species captured by trawling were detected by CO1, which detected an additional 98 species. We demonstrate that eDNA is capable of detecting patterns of community assemblage and species turnover in an offshore environment, emphasizing its strong potential for a non-invasive, comprehensive, and scalable tool for biodiversity monitoring supporting marine conservation programmes.},
